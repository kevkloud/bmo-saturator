/** The presets that ship with the plugin.

    These are starting points, not verdicts. They have been checked against
    what the plugin measures -- `measure sweep` reports every one of these
    drive settings -- and they have not been checked by ear on real material,
    which is the only test that finally matters.

    Most of them push Input and pull Output back, because the curve is
    level-dependent: how hard the signal arrives is half of how much colour it
    gets, exactly as it is on hardware. The two are not equal and opposite,
    since the curve has a broadband loss of its own; the Output figures below
    are the ones that measured level on the reference voice, which is why they
    are odd numbers rather than round ones.

    Anything a preset does not mention goes back to its default, so a preset
    cannot leave a stray setting behind from whatever was loaded before it.

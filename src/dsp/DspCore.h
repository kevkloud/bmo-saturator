/** Everything the plugin does to audio, with no dependency on JUCE's plugin
    layer or on a host. Takes plain values and raw buffers, so the measurement
    harness and the unit tests can drive the real signal path directly.

    The chain, per channel, inside the oversampled region:

        input trim -> the fitted curve
                   -> plus two harmonic generators, each filling one band
                   -> DC blocker -> makeup -> output trim

    The generators are the unusual part, and they are the reason this hits the
    brief rather than merely saturating.

    A waveshaper applied the ordinary way -- signal in, shaped signal out --
    distributes its new harmonics wherever they fall. On a voice that is mostly
    the 600 Hz to 2.5 kHz octaves, since that is where the second and third
    harmonics of the fundamental land. The reference this plugin is fitted to
    does the opposite: it leaves everything below 2.5 kHz within about a dB of
    where it started and puts 6 to 8 dB of new energy above it. No single curve
    applied to the whole signal does that at any drive setting. Push it hard
    enough to fill the top and the midrange fills with it.

    So the fitted curve runs across the whole signal and carries the character
    -- the asymmetry, the even-order content, the compression the reference
    measured -- and two further instances of the same curve at the same drive
    place the new energy. Each is fed only the band below a corner and read
    only above it, so what it contributes is harmonic content that was not
    there before rather than a scaled copy of the programme. They are still
    harmonics of the programme, made by the same asymmetric curve and carrying
    its even-order signature; they are simply weighted towards the part of the
    spectrum the target puts them in.

    That structure also settles the dynamics. The dry path through the stage is
    never attenuated, so the programme's own peaks arrive intact and the added
    residual is largest exactly where the waveform moves fastest -- on
    transients. The crest factor comes out slightly up, which is what was asked
    for. There is no compressor, limiter, or peak reduction anywhere in here,
    and adding one would be a change of design rather than a feature.

        a synthetic signal that may or may not resemble one. That distinction
        cost a release: the first fit was made against a test signal with 22 dB
        less energy above 6 kHz than the actual reference vocal, so the same
        harmonic generation that measured +8 dB on the test signal measured
        +0.4 dB on the real thing.

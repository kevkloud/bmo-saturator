/** One-pole topology-preserving (TPT) filter, after Zavalishin.

    Two properties matter here and neither holds for a direct-form one-pole.

    Its state stays meaningful while the coefficients move, so the band split
    can follow a smoothed control without the coefficient discontinuity that
    makes a direct form click.

    And its low-pass and high-pass outputs sum to the input exactly, sample for
    sample, at every frequency. That is what makes the two-band split in
    DspCore a split rather than a filter: with the saturation switched out the
    two bands recombine to the signal that went in, so a bypass nulls and a
    partial Mix cannot comb.

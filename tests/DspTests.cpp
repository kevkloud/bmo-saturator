/*
    Tests for the DSP core. No JUCE, no host, no audio device: the core takes
    plain buffers, so everything the plugin claims about itself can be checked
    on a bare container in a couple of seconds.

    The tests that matter most are the ones holding the character in place --
    the curve's asymmetry, its even-order balance, where in the spectrum the
    new energy lands, and the fact that the crest factor does not fall. Those
    are the four things the plugin was specified with, and a change that
    quietly breaks one of them is exactly the change nobody notices.

    test here is the important one: switching Auto Gain on must not change the
